        <h1>2024 Running Goals</h1>
        <p>I picked up running in 2022 to train for the Madison Half Marathon. 
            I continued running in 2023 and ended up injured due to a high mileage ramp-up and poor footwear. 
            The theme I set going into 2024 is to build a baseline:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting miles in consistently (ideally 1000)</li>
            <li>Find out if zone 2 running is real</li>
            <li>Call myself a marathoner</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The purpose of this site is two-fold. To brush up on my html/css/js while also keeping myself accountable in filling up the graphs</p>
